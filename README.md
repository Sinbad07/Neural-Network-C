# Neural-Network-C
Back-propagational Neural Network in C++

Initial project was done for a programming module but not fully functional, goal here is to update and create fully functional code.

New specification

General purpose neural network capable of:
- taking up to 5 input variables
- saving/loading weights to/from file
- calculating averaged data to use effectively with weights

Revamped branch:
Will differ slightly in under the hood calculations, i.e. slightly different functions following a different means for the same method
